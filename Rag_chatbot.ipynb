Each student group has assigned office space. Students choose a project from an approved list, all related to a common theme of study. Each project group is assigned two faculty advisers. Projects are categorized into assignment projects, subject projects, and problem projects, emphasizing problem analysis and solving. Different levels of teacher control exist among project types, with \\\"problem projects\\\" resembling problem-based learning in terms of student direction of learning. A \\\"process-oriented supervisor\\\" role is defined for problem-based learning, compared with a \\\"product-oriented supervisor\\\" role in project-based learning. Monash University: The first year of the program involves project-assisted learning in one Civil Engineering subject. Second-year courses include both generic skill development and civil engineering-based courses. Courses continue to use project-assisted learning, with an emphasis on students finding required information. Third-year courses adopt a project-based learning model. In the final year, students operate with significant autonomy in setting projects and finding resources. Central Queensland University (CQU): CQU introduced a project-based engineering degree, with all specializations adopting a project-based model. 50% of students' workload in each semester is allocated to a project-based unit. Each semester consists of two theoretical knowledge development courses and a project-based course. Projects increase in length and difficulty as the program progresses. CQU's first-year courses focus on team-work, communication, computing, problem-solving, and introducing engineering issues like ethics and environmental factors. The program also includes a co-operative format, with two semesters of industrial work placement.\",\n          \"Method: Pair Programming Approach: - In the Fall and Winter classes, pair programming was implemented. - Students were required to spend at least 75% of their total assignment time physically working with their partner. - The roles of driving and reviewing were alternated between partners at intervals of no more than 1 hour. - Students were provided with resources on pair programming and encouraged to read relevant papers. - Re-pairing occurred only if scheduling conflicts or repeated absences were an issue. - Students could request to work alone but were still required to fill out time logs. Pairing Process: - Pairing was based on student requests, where each student submitted a list of three preferred partners. - In the Fall quarter, paired students had to be enrolled in the same section. - In the Winter quarter, preferences were used to create a weighted graph, and pairs were selected based on the order of weight. - Students not selected through this process were randomly paired with others. - The pairing process aimed to ensure an equal number of women paired with women and women paired with men. Data Collection: - Entrance and exit surveys were conducted in each class, collecting information on previous programming experience and mathematics strength. - Only the Spring class, without pair programming, required students to complete time logs indicating work time, satisfaction with solutions, and satisfaction with the problem-solving experience. - Students in the paired classes also completed time logs, which additionally included satisfaction with working with a partner and time spent driving, reviewing, and working alone. - Factors such as programming experience and grade point average were not considered during the pairing process.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Class size\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 18,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"*(the students work in groups of 5 but with no tutor).\",\n          \"The participants were 54 students (ranging in age from 20 to 22) from three classes of the software engineering course, which is an elective subject of the department of computer science in the university.\",\n          \"43 students enrolled in this course at YU during spring 2013.

This helps students learn at their own pace and get more practice solving problems.              The primary objective of the flipped classroom active learning technique is to shift the traditional education paradigm by reimagining the roles of in-class and out-of-class activities. The approach aims to enhance student engagement, critical thinking, and comprehension by reorganizing the learning process. By assigning instructional content for self-paced learning outside of class, such as through videos or readings, valuable in-class time can be dedicated to interactive and collaborative activities. This promotes deeper understanding through discussions, problem-solving, peer interactions, and immediate feedback from instructors. The flipped classroom seeks to create a more dynamic and student-centered learning environment that fosters active participation, encourages active learning, and ultimately enhances students' retention and application of knowledge. nan Cho, H., Zhao, K., Lee, C. R., Runshe, D., & Krousgrill, C. M. (2021). Active learning through flipped classroom in mechanical engineering: improving students’ perception of learning and performance. International Journal of STEM Education, 8(1).              This course studies the statics of deformable materials upon applying external mechanical forces and/or thermal load. The key elements of the class include stress and strain in machine elements; mechanical properties of materials; extension, torsion, and bending of members; thermal stress; failure analysis; and design of a variety of structures. Pre-Lecture videos Pre-lecture videos were recorded and edited in Camtasia and uploaded to Blackboard. Each video was 10 to 15 minutes long and covered the concepts of the topics that would be discussed in the coming week. The face-to-face instruction was taught on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, with each session lasting 50 minutes. Students were asked to watch the recorded videos before the Monday class each week. Watching the pre-lecture video does not automatically equate to students’ learning. For this reason, the instructor provided a pre-quiz prior to the in-person class so that students would watch the video and check their knowledge through the pre-quiz. In-class activities In the flipped, face-to-face classroom, the instructor recapped the concepts from the videos, focusing on examples and practicing problem-solving as individual students or as groups of two to three students. Students were encouraged to work together on the course materials. The instructor facilitated the discussions throughout the problem-solving process. Half of the Friday class was dedicated to a group quiz when students could work together on a problem, but each student submitted individual work. The difficulty level of the group quiz was comparable to homework and exam problems to bridge the gap between the in-class practice and assessment for students. The instructor facilitated interactions between peers to solve problems and provided help when students had questions solving the quiz problem. In total, there were 99 students in the traditional classroom in Fall 2014 and Spring 2015, while there were 313 students in the flipped classroom from Fall 2015 to Fall 2017.

            "2. **Pre-Quiz:** Provide a pre-quiz related to the pre-lecture videos to assess students' understanding and ensure they have engaged with the material before the in-person class. This helps reinforce learning and prepares students for discussions and activities in class.\n",
