The study aimed to assess the impact of active learning on student engagement, understanding of complex concepts, and overall learning outcomes. Various active learning techniques, including problem-based learning, case studies, and hands-on experiments, were incorporated into the course curriculum. Student performance and feedback were collected and analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies. The results indicated that active learning significantly improved student engagement, critical thinking skills, and retention of knowledge in biomedical engineering. The study provides insights into the benefits of incorporating active learning strategies in biomedical engineering education and offers recommendations for future implementation.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper presents a case study on the implementation of virtual labs as an active learning strategy in a biomedical engineering course. The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of virtual labs in improving student understanding of complex biomedical engineering concepts and enhancing practical skills. Virtual labs were developed to simulate real-world experiments and scenarios, allowing students to engage in hands-on learning activities in a virtual environment. Student performance data, surveys, and assessments were collected to evaluate the impact of virtual labs on student learning outcomes. The results demonstrated that virtual labs significantly increased student engagement, critical thinking abilities, and retention of knowledge in biomedical engineering. The study highlights the potential of virtual labs as an effective active learning tool in biomedical engineering education.\n",
            "\n",
            "This example illustrates how virtual labs can be utilized as an active learning strategy to enhance student learning in the field of biomedical engineering.\n"

This helps students learn at their own pace and get more practice solving problems.              The primary objective of the flipped classroom active learning technique is to shift the traditional education paradigm by reimagining the roles of in-class and out-of-class activities. The approach aims to enhance student engagement, critical thinking, and comprehension by reorganizing the learning process. By assigning instructional content for self-paced learning outside of class, such as through videos or readings, valuable in-class time can be dedicated to interactive and collaborative activities. This promotes deeper understanding through discussions, problem-solving, peer interactions, and immediate feedback from instructors. The flipped classroom seeks to create a more dynamic and student-centered learning environment that fosters active participation, encourages active learning, and ultimately enhances students' retention and application of knowledge. nan Cho, H., Zhao, K., Lee, C. R., Runshe, D., & Krousgrill, C. M. (2021). Active learning through flipped classroom in mechanical engineering: improving students’ perception of learning and performance. International Journal of STEM Education, 8(1).              This course studies the statics of deformable materials upon applying external mechanical forces and/or thermal load. The key elements of the class include stress and strain in machine elements; mechanical properties of materials; extension, torsion, and bending of members; thermal stress; failure analysis; and design of a variety of structures. Pre-Lecture videos Pre-lecture videos were recorded and edited in Camtasia and uploaded to Blackboard. Each video was 10 to 15 minutes long and covered the concepts of the topics that would be discussed in the coming week. The face-to-face instruction was taught on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, with each session lasting 50 minutes. Students were asked to watch the recorded videos before the Monday class each week. Watching the pre-lecture video does not automatically equate to students’ learning. For this reason, the instructor provided a pre-quiz prior to the in-person class so that students would watch the video and check their knowledge through the pre-quiz. In-class activities In the flipped, face-to-face classroom, the instructor recapped the concepts from the videos, focusing on examples and practicing problem-solving as individual students or as groups of two to three students. Students were encouraged to work together on the course materials. The instructor facilitated the discussions throughout the problem-solving process. Half of the Friday class was dedicated to a group quiz when students could work together on a problem, but each student submitted individual work. The difficulty level of the group quiz was comparable to homework and exam problems to bridge the gap between the in-class practice and assessment for students. The instructor facilitated interactions between peers to solve problems and provided help when students had questions solving the quiz problem. In total, there were 99 students in the traditional classroom in Fall 2014 and Spring 2015, while there were 313 students in the flipped classroom from Fall 2015 to Fall 2017. The majority of students were domestic students (64.6%), while 35.4% of students were international students.              Results demonstrated that students in the flipped classroom performed better and favored the new model, feeling that flipped classroom was useful and helpful in preparing for the course.

The primary objective of the flipped classroom active learning technique is to shift the traditional education paradigm by reimagining the roles of in-class and out-of-class activities. The approach aims to enhance student engagement, critical thinking, and comprehension by reorganizing the learning process. By assigning instructional content for self-paced learning outside of class, such as through videos or readings, valuable in-class time can be dedicated to interactive and collaborative activities. This promotes deeper understanding through discussions, problem-solving, peer interactions, and immediate feedback from instructors. The flipped classroom seeks to create a more dynamic and student-centered learning environment that fosters active participation, encourages active learning, and ultimately enhances students' retention and application of knowledge. nan Cho, H., Zhao, K., Lee, C. R., Runshe, D., & Krousgrill, C. M. (2021). Active learning through flipped classroom in mechanical engineering: improving students’ perception of learning and performance. International Journal of STEM Education, 8(1).              This course studies the statics of deformable materials upon applying external mechanical forces and/or thermal load. The key elements of the class include stress and strain in machine elements; mechanical properties of materials; extension, torsion, and bending of members; thermal stress; failure analysis; and design of a variety of structures. Pre-Lecture videos Pre-lecture videos were recorded and edited in Camtasia and uploaded to Blackboard. Each video was 10 to 15 minutes long and covered the concepts of the topics that would be discussed in the coming week. The face-to-face instruction was taught on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, with each session lasting 50 minutes. Students were asked to watch the recorded videos before the Monday class each week. Watching the pre-lecture video does not automatically equate to students’ learning. For this reason, the instructor provided a pre-quiz prior to the in-person class so that students would watch the video and check their knowledge through the pre-quiz. In-class activities In the flipped, face-to-face classroom, the instructor recapped the concepts from the videos, focusing on examples and practicing problem-solving as individual students or as groups of two to three students. Students were encouraged to work together on the course materials. The instructor facilitated the discussions throughout the problem-solving process. Half of the Friday class was dedicated to a group quiz when students could work together on a problem, but each student submitted individual work. The difficulty level of the group quiz was comparable to homework and exam problems to bridge the gap between the in-class practice and assessment for students. The instructor facilitated interactions between peers to solve problems and provided help when students had questions solving the quiz problem. In total, there were 99 students in the traditional classroom in Fall 2014 and Spring 2015, while there were 313 students in the flipped classroom from Fall 2015 to Fall 2017. The majority of students were domestic students (64.6%), while 35.4% of students were international students.              Results demonstrated that students in the flipped classroom performed better and favored the new model, feeling that flipped classroom was useful and helpful in preparing for the course. The qualitative findings showed that students felt that they benefited from the pre-week online lectures in the flipped classroom to prepare for the course. nan S-C,S-S,S-T              nan A A,S              nan\n",

(2019). Motivational impact of active learning methods in aerospace engineering students. Acta Astronautica, 165, 344–354. nan              In this contribution, the motivation of students of the Master of Aerospace Engineering degree of the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid is analyzed in two subjects that use different educational techniques. A teaching centered approach is applied in one subject, while active learning methods like Project Based Learning are applied in the other. In this second approach, students are required to perform a preliminary design of a Space Mission starting from Mission requirements and must integrate the subsystems of a microsatellite using demonstration satellites. A reliable instrument tailored for engineering students has been used during two academic years to evaluate the impact of these techniques on the students’ motivation. nan The empirical experience described here confirms the positive impact of active learning methods and indicates the key factors, both intrinsic and extrinsic, in the motivation of aerospace engineering students.              nan nan nan              nan nan nan              nan\n",

This helps students learn to think critically and explain their reasoning. Muddiest-point - Students write down the muddiest point they had in a lecture on a card. The instructor collects the cards and addresses the students' questions at the end of the lecture. This helps students identify and clarify their understanding of the material. Electronic response systems - Students use electronic devices to respond to questions posed by the instructor. This helps the instructor assess student understanding and identify areas where further instruction is needed. Concept Tests - Students take short, multiple-choice tests on concepts covered in class. This helps students assess their own understanding of the material and identify areas where they need to study more. Web based evaluations - Students can access course materials and information on the instructor's course web page. They can also complete web-based course evaluations to provide feedback on the course.
