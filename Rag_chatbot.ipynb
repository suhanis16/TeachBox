The flipped classroom approach involved assigning students pre-recorded lectures and readings to review before class, while in-class time was dedicated to active learning activities such as group discussions, problem-solving exercises, and peer teaching.\n",
            "\n",
            "Peer instruction was incorporated through activities like think-pair-share, where students worked in pairs to explain concepts to each other before sharing their understanding with the larger group. The study evaluated the impact of these active learning strategies on student engagement, comprehension of complex biomedical engineering concepts, and overall learning outcomes.\n",

            "The research findings demonstrated that the combination of flipped classroom and peer instruction strategies significantly improved student participation, critical thinking skills, and knowledge retention in the biomedical engineering course. The study highlights the effectiveness of active learning approaches in enhancing the quality of education in the field of biomedical engineering.\n",

The primary objective of the flipped classroom active learning technique is to shift the traditional education paradigm by reimagining the roles of in-class and out-of-class activities. The approach aims to enhance student engagement, critical thinking, and comprehension by reorganizing the learning process. By assigning instructional content for self-paced learning outside of class, such as through videos or readings, valuable in-class time can be dedicated to interactive and collaborative activities. This promotes deeper understanding through discussions, problem-solving, peer interactions, and immediate feedback from instructors. The flipped classroom seeks to create a more dynamic and student-centered learning environment that fosters active participation, encourages active learning, and ultimately enhances students' retention and application of knowledge. nan Cho, H., Zhao, K., Lee, C. R., Runshe, D., & Krousgrill, C. M. (2021). Active learning through flipped classroom in mechanical engineering: improving students’ perception of learning and performance. International Journal of STEM Education, 8(1).              This course studies the statics of deformable materials upon applying external mechanical forces and/or thermal load. The key elements of the class include stress and strain in machine elements; mechanical properties of materials; extension, torsion, and bending of members; thermal stress; failure analysis; and design of a variety of structures. Pre-Lecture videos Pre-lecture videos were recorded and edited in Camtasia and uploaded to Blackboard. Each video was 10 to 15 minutes long and covered the concepts of the topics that would be discussed in the coming week. The face-to-face instruction was taught on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, with each session lasting 50 minutes. Students were asked to watch the recorded videos before the Monday class each week. Watching the pre-lecture video does not automatically equate to students’ learning. For this reason, the instructor provided a pre-quiz prior to the in-person class so that students would watch the video and check their knowledge through the pre-quiz. In-class activities In the flipped, face-to-face classroom, the instructor recapped the concepts from the videos, focusing on examples and practicing problem-solving as individual students or as groups of two to three students. Students were encouraged to work together on the course materials. The instructor facilitated the discussions throughout the problem-solving process. Half of the Friday class was dedicated to a group quiz when students could work together on a problem, but each student submitted individual work. The difficulty level of the group quiz was comparable to homework and exam problems to bridge the gap between the in-class practice and assessment for students. The instructor facilitated interactions between peers to solve problems and provided help when students had questions solving the quiz problem. In total, there were 99 students in the traditional classroom in Fall 2014 and Spring 2015, while there were 313 students in the flipped classroom from Fall 2015 to Fall 2017. The majority of students were domestic students (64.6%), while 35.4% of students were international students.              Results demonstrated that students in the flipped classroom performed better and favored the new model, feeling that flipped classroom was useful and helpful in preparing for the course.

This helps students learn what they need to know when they need to know it.              nan nan Liberatore, M. W. (n.d.). Effectiveness of Just in Time Teaching on Student Achievement in an Introductory Thermodynamics Course. EJ1138854.pdf (ed.gov)              The major concepts covered in the course included: demonstrating a logical and rigorous problem solving ability, computing thermodynamic properties of pure fluids - such as water/steam, and solving steady state and transient processes using the first and second laws of thermodynamics. The three authors delivered two sections of the course in parallel during the Fall 2014 semester. The large section met Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 8:00 to 8:50am while the small section met for 75 minutes on Tuesdays and Tuesdays starting at 12:30pm. The three instructors met weekly to keep the content delivered each week in sync. The average GPA for each section before the semester was calculated and found to be statistically equivalent (+/- 0.02 points). Both sections employed the same active learning strategies: short periods of lecture, usually 15 minutes or less, were interspersed with examples. Generally, examples were worked in groups of 2 or 3 with the instructor or instructors walking the room to answer questions and provide encouragement. The large section included 4 total instructors with two graduate student teaching assistants helping the two professors during most class periods. Thus, the student to instructor ratio was ~ 40:1 in the large section and ~ 50:1 in the small section. Creating the small classroom within a large classroom has been documented elsewhere. In addition, a number of examples throughout the semester employed YouTube videos. The YouTube pedagogy has been published previously, and the YouTube problems were the same for both sections. Overall, the teaching styles and examples were similar between the two sections, and therefore, the presentation of Just-In-Time-Teaching examples could serve as a basis to compare the two sections. The instructors’ response using JITT took a number of forms. The JITT exercise is completed at the beginning of class, and the response includes some lecture related to the troublesome concept followed by active problem solving. Generally, the JITT problems were a variation of the homework problem with the lowest ‘score’ (problem response data was discussed earlier). Short answer or sketching diagrams were completed with neighboring students so the results could be discussed and refined. Longer problems, similar in length to a homework problem, were also given and took 10 to 15 minutes of the class period. Some of the problems were based on YouTube videos and problems written by students in previous semesters as published elsewhere 28-30. Overall, the amount of class time was budgeted relative to the success, or lack thereof, on the just completed homework. The large section enrolled 161 students with Professors Liberatore and Vestal co-teaching. Professor Morrish taught the small section with 51 students. While 67% of the students were of sophomore standing when taking the course, junior (25%) and senior (8%) students also enrolled. The diversity in class standing is a result of the students’ different majors: 30% chemical engineering (ChE), 32% chemical and biochemical engineering (CBE), 20% engineering physics, 8% civil engineering, and 10% other engineering or science majors.              An approach using online homework to guide Just-In-Time-Teaching exercises in an Introduction to Engineering Thermodynamics course found differences in student performance. The online homework platform provided immediate feedback to students and revealed problematic concepts for the class as a whole. Once identified, these challenging topics were reiterated during the class period following homework submission. The impact of using the JITT exercises on student achievement was then evaluated using in class quizzes and exams. With about 200 students in the course, student performance on a topic covered by a JITT exercise was found to be measurably higher (> 9.0%) than a control group who did not receive the next-day review. While less definitive, comparison of student achievement on a series of topics covered by JITT versus those not covered (No JITT) did show positive outcomes of the approach. These results may indicate that the immediate topical review is more helpful for the mid-performing students. Overall, student feedback on JITT exercises was highly favorable with over 85% of students responding that JITT exercises were helpful for engagement and a good use of class time. nan nan              nan nan nan              nan', metadata={'A,S': 'nan', 'Citation': 'Liberatore, M.

            "    Mechanical Engineering Flipped Classroom Students watch lectures or other instructional materials outside of class and then come to class to work on problems and discuss the material. This helps students learn at their own pace and get more practice solving problems.              The primary objective of the flipped classroom active learning technique is to shift the traditional education paradigm by reimagining the roles of in-class and out-of-class activities. The approach aims to enhance student engagement, critical thinking, and comprehension by reorganizing the learning process. By assigning instructional content for self-paced learning outside of class, such as through videos or readings, valuable in-class time can be dedicated to interactive and collaborative activities. This promotes deeper understanding through discussions, problem-solving, peer interactions, and immediate feedback from instructors. The flipped classroom seeks to create a more dynamic and student-centered learning environment that fosters active participation, encourages active learning, and ultimately enhances students' retention and application of knowledge. nan Cho, H., Zhao, K., Lee, C. R., Runshe, D., & Krousgrill, C. M. (2021). Active learning through flipped classroom in mechanical engineering: improving students’ perception of learning and performance. International Journal of STEM Education, 8(1).              This course studies the statics of deformable materials upon applying external mechanical forces and/or thermal load. The key elements of the class include stress and strain in machine elements; mechanical properties of materials; extension, torsion, and bending of members; thermal stress; failure analysis; and design of a variety of structures. Pre-Lecture videos Pre-lecture videos were recorded and edited in Camtasia and uploaded to Blackboard. Each video was 10 to 15 minutes long and covered the concepts of the topics that would be discussed in the coming week. The face-to-face instruction was taught on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, with each session lasting 50 minutes. Students were asked to watch the recorded videos before the Monday class each week. Watching the pre-lecture video does not automatically equate to students’ learning. For this reason, the instructor provided a pre-quiz prior to the in-person class so that students would watch the video and check their knowledge through the pre-quiz. In-class activities In the flipped, face-to-face classroom, the instructor recapped the concepts from the videos, focusing on examples and practicing problem-solving as individual students or as groups of two to three students. Students were encouraged to work together on the course materials. The instructor facilitated the discussions throughout the problem-solving process. Half of the Friday class was dedicated to a group quiz when students could work together on a problem, but each student submitted individual work. The difficulty level of the group quiz was comparable to homework and exam problems to bridge the gap between the in-class practice and assessment for students. The instructor facilitated interactions between peers to solve problems and provided help when students had questions solving the quiz problem. In total, there were 99 students in the traditional classroom in Fall 2014 and Spring 2015, while there were 313 students in the flipped classroom from Fall 2015 to Fall 2017. The majority of students were domestic students (64.6%), while 35.4% of students were international students.              Results demonstrated that students in the flipped classroom performed better and favored the new model, feeling that flipped classroom was useful and helpful in preparing for the course. The qualitative findings showed that students felt that they benefited from the pre-week online lectures in the flipped classroom to prepare for the course. nan S-C,S-S,S-T              nan A A,S              nan\n",
            "Biomedical Engineering Just in time Teaching The instructor provides instruction on topics that students need to know to solve the problem. This helps students learn what they need to know when they need to know it.              nan nan Liberatore, M. W. (n.d.). Effectiveness of Just in Time Teaching on Student Achievement in an Introductory Thermodynamics Course. EJ1138854.pdf (ed.gov)              The major concepts covered in the course included: demonstrating a logical and rigorous problem solving ability, computing thermodynamic properties of pure fluids - such as water/steam, and solving steady state and transient processes using the first and second laws of thermodynamics. The three authors delivered two sections of the course in parallel during the Fall 2014 semester. The large section met Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 8:00 to 8:50am while the small section met for 75 minutes on Tuesdays and Tuesdays starting at 12:30pm. The three instructors met weekly to keep the content delivered each week in sync. The average GPA for each section before the semester was calculated and found to be statistically equivalent (+/- 0.02 points). Both sections employed the same active learning strategies: short periods of lecture, usually 15 minutes or less, were interspersed with examples. Generally, examples were worked in groups of 2 or 3 with the instructor or instructors walking the room to answer questions and provide encouragement. The large section included 4 total instructors with two graduate student teaching assistants helping the two professors during most class periods. Thus, the student to instructor ratio was ~ 40:1 in the large section and ~ 50:1 in the small section. Creating the small classroom within a large classroom has been documented elsewhere. In addition, a number of examples throughout the semester employed YouTube videos. The YouTube pedagogy has been published previously, and the YouTube problems were the same for both sections. Overall, the teaching styles and examples were similar between the two sections, and therefore, the presentation of Just-In-Time-Teaching examples could serve as a basis to compare the two sections. The instructors’ response using JITT took a number of forms. The JITT exercise is completed at the beginning of class, and the response includes some lecture related to the troublesome concept followed by active problem solving. Generally, the JITT problems were a variation of the homework problem with the lowest ‘score’ (problem response data was discussed earlier). Short answer or sketching diagrams were completed with neighboring students so the results could be discussed and refined. Longer problems, similar in length to a homework problem, were also given and took 10 to 15 minutes of the class period. Some of the problems were based on YouTube videos and problems written by students in previous semesters as published elsewhere 28-30. Overall, the amount of class time was budgeted relative to the success, or lack thereof, on the just completed homework. The large section enrolled 161 students with Professors Liberatore and Vestal co-teaching. Professor Morrish taught the small section with 51 students. While 67% of the students were of sophomore standing when taking the course, junior (25%) and senior (8%) students also enrolled. The diversity in class standing is a result of the students’ different majors: 30% chemical engineering (ChE), 32% chemical and biochemical engineering (CBE), 20% engineering physics, 8% civil engineering, and 10% other engineering or science majors.              An approach using online homework to guide Just-In-Time-Teaching exercises in an Introduction to Engineering Thermodynamics course found differences in student performance. The online homework platform provided immediate feedback to students and revealed problematic concepts for the class as a whole. Once identified, these challenging topics were reiterated during the class period following homework submission. The impact of using the JITT exercises on student achievement was then evaluated using in class quizzes and exams. With about 200 students in the course, student performance on a topic covered by a JITT exercise was found to be measurably higher (> 9.0%) than a control group who did not receive the next-day review. While less definitive, comparison of student achievement on a series of topics covered by JITT versus those not covered (No JITT) did show positive outcomes of the approach. These results may indicate that the immediate topical review is more helpful for the mid-performing students. Overall, student feedback on JITT exercises was highly favorable with over 85% of students responding that JITT exercises were helpful for engagement and a good use of class time. nan nan              nan nan nan              nan\n",

            "To teach Thermodynamics using active learning strategies, one effective approach is to implement the flipped classroom model. In the context of Mechanical Engineering, the flipped classroom technique involves students watching pre-recorded lectures or instructional materials outside of class and then using in-class time for problem-solving activities and discussions related to the material. This method helps students learn at their own pace, engage in hands-on activities, and receive immediate feedback from instructors. Here's how you can adapt this strategy to teach Thermodynamics:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Pre-Lecture Videos: Create short, engaging videos covering key concepts in Thermodynamics using tools like Camtasia and upload them to a learning management system (e.g., Blackboard). Encourage students to watch these videos before coming to class to ensure they have a basic understanding of the topics.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. In-Class Activities: During face-to-face sessions, use class time to recap the concepts from the videos, work on examples, and engage students in problem-solving exercises either individually or in small groups. Encourage peer interactions and discussions to deepen understanding and promote collaborative learning.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Group Quizzes: Allocate time for group quizzes where students can work together on challenging problems that mirror homework and exam questions. This practice helps bridge the gap between in-class practice and assessment, providing students with opportunities to apply their knowledge in a supportive environment.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Student Engagement: Foster interactions among peers by facilitating group problem-solving sessions and providing guidance when students encounter difficulties. Encourage active participation and teamwork to enhance students' problem-solving skills and critical thinking abilities.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Assessment and Feedback: Use in-class quizzes and exams to evaluate student performance on topics covered through the flipped classroom approach. Offer immediate feedback on challenging concepts and provide additional support as needed to address learning gaps.\n",
            "\n",
            "By implementing the flipped classroom model for teaching Thermodynamics, you can create an interactive and dynamic learning environment that promotes student engagement, collaboration, and deeper comprehension of complex concepts in Mechanical Engineering. The flipped classroom strategy allows students to learn actively, apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems, and receive timely feedback, ultimately enhancing their learning experience and academic performance.\n"
